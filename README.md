# Conformist: Limitations of measuring mathematical reasoning in (M)LLM

This repository contains dataset used in the paper. 
<br>
ParallelMath: We present ParallelMath, which contains geometric math problems with paral-
lel lines and traversal intersecting to form alternate, corresponding, co-interior, linear
angles. It comes in a horizontal and vertical pair with exact same text question and
answer. 
<br>

A subsets from MathVista and MATH-V.
<br>
These datasets are manually verified to ensure the question’s equivalence remains
constant when a “flip” or “rotate by 90 degrees clockwise” transformation is applied
to the images, with the text question and answer remaining the same.
